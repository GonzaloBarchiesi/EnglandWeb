            <h3>Foundation: </h3>
            <p> In the 10th century, after resisting and repelling a series of Viking attacks, England was politically unified under the monarch of the then kingdom of Wessex (the main Anglo-Saxon power) Athelstan, grandson of Alfred the Great.

            <h3>Form of government:</h3>
             <p>  The actual government is a Parliamentary monarchy: Political form of the State in which the king is the head of State, but his acts are endorsed by the President of the Government and, where appropriate, by the competent ministers, who are responsible for said acts.
                    The person that takes the role of president is the king himself. A king isn't chosen by anybody but from the previous king (his father) because they go from generation to generation belonging to a unique family.

            <h3> Flag: </h3>
            <p> This is one of the oldest badges in the world. The cross is vertical, and is combined with the color white. Red is dark, and the history of the flag has a lot to do with a saint, the one known as Saint George. This gives its name to the cross, which is known as 'Saint George's Cross'.  </p>
